octahedrone
===========

Generative Audio Visual Sketch

The sketch is an audio visual experiment that uses Web Audio API for sound sythesis/processing and THREE.JS for WebGL 3D rendering.

The background sounds are being generated in real-time using Web Audio API while each face of the floating octahedron has a certain sustaining note which allows you to create evolving arpeggios and textures by clicking on different faces.

Clicking anywhere else will change the color of the background objects which combined with mouse movment results in interesting textures in the background as well as subtle stereo panning on the background sounds.

Runs best on Google Chrome.
